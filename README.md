# **Online Tutorials Management System**

## **Project Overview**

This is an application for managing online tutorials that provides two modes: **Administrator Mode** and **User Mode**. It is built using **C++** with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and follows a **Layered Architecture** design. The **Qt framework** is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI), and **MySQL** is utilized for managing the tutorials database. Users can interact with the system either by browsing tutorials, liking them, or adding them to their watchlist. Administrators have the ability to add, update, and delete tutorials.

## **Features**

### **Administrator Mode**
- Add new tutorials to the database.
- Update existing tutorials.
- Delete tutorials.
  
### **User Mode**
- Browse tutorials.
- Like tutorials.
- Add tutorials to a personal watchlist.
  - The watchlist can be saved and exported in two formats:
    - **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**: To store tutorials in an Excel-like format.
    - **HTML**: To display the watchlist in a table on a webpage.

## **Technologies Used**

- **C++ (OOP)**: Main programming language.
- **Qt Framework**: For creating the GUI.
- **MySQL**: For storing the primary database of tutorials.

## **How to Use**

### **Administrator Mode**
1. Add, update, or delete tutorials by using the provided form.
2. Data is saved directly into the MySQL database.

### **User Mode**
1. Browse through the list of available tutorials.
2. "Like" tutorials by clicking the corresponding button.
3. Add tutorials to your watchlist and export them in either CSV or HTML format.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add advanced filtering options for users to search for tutorials.
- Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
- Add the ability for users to leave comments on tutorials.
